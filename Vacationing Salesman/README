1. To run:
    $node vacationing-salesman.js < cities.txt

2. Language choice:
    I choose node because of npm library support, and also because
    I haven't coded javascript in a while and wanted a refresher

3. Decisions
    The main decisions I had to make were how to discover the locations
    of the list of cities, and how to calculate their distances. I settled
    on Google's geocoding api because of it's documentation and ease of use

    I also made many choices on how to split the problem into easily solvable
    subtasks, where each function I wrote completed a part of the solution.

4. Time
    Although I did manage to finish, it took me the entire 3 hours, spending 45
    minutes on Deck of Cards and the rest on Vacationing Salesman. Remembering how
    to write async node functions took longer than I expected, and so did figuring
    out how to utilize Google's api. If I had extra time, I would definitely spend that
    time on correctly catchinge errors in my javascript callbacks, as I currently assume
    all callback funtions are not passed error inputs.
