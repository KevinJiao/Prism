1. Design decisions

I choose to write this framework in Java beause of its OOP capabilities,
so I could take advantage of Java's inheritance features.

2. Ambiguities

There were very few ambiguities in the instructions, and they were
dealt with relatively easily. To signal an error when GetNextCard()
does not have another card to return, I choose to throw a
NoSuchElement exception, which is what Java's default iterator class does.
I assumed once a card was dealt it cannot be dealt again, which is how decks
work in real life.

3. Testing

There were only two main functions that were required, which I tested in
ExampleUsage.java.

4. Usage

javac *.java

java ExampleUsage
